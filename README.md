# SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts   

# Introduction
Data is analyzed for employees of a company by using data modeling, data engineering. The given CSV file was converted into a correspinding SQL table. Once the SQL table was created, inquiried such as the details of each employee and a list fo the employees hired in 1986 were answered.

# Process
1. The CSV's were observed and an ERD of the tables were sketched out as prelinary step. 
2. A table schema for each of the six CSV files was created based on the information that was gievn. Data types, primary keys, foreign keys and other constraints were specified. 
3. Each CSV file was imported into a correspinding SQL table. 
4. The details of each employee such as employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary were listed in a table. 
5. Employees that were hired in 1986 were also listed in another table. 
6. The manager of each department with information such as department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates were listed. 
7. The department of each employee with information such as employee number, last name, first name, and department name was listed. 
8. Employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B" was listed. 
9. All employees in the Sales department, including information such as employee number, last name, first name, and department name was listed. 
10. all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including information such as employee number, last name, first name, and department name was listed. 
11. The frequency count of employee last names in descending order was listed.  

# Technology Used
* PLSQL

# Conclusion
After each CSV file was imported the questions were able to be answered in the tables created from the code.
